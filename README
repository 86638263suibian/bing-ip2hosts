INTRODUCTION
------------
Bing.com is a search engine owned by Microsoft formerly known as MSN Search and Live Search. It has a unique feature to search for websites hosted on a specific IP address. This feature is can be used with the IP: parameter in the search query, eg. "IP:1.2.3.4"

Bing-ip2hosts uses this feature to enumerate all hostnames which Bing has indexed for a specific IP address. This technique is considered best practice during the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test in order to discover a larger potential attack surface. Bing-ip2hosts is written in the Bash scripting language for Linux.

HELP
